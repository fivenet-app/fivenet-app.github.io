title: Requirements
---

## Must have

- MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.0+ database - This will be the same database that your FiveM gameserver uses.* Make sure that your database table structure is following the [below structure](#database) (the structure is based on recent ESX versions).
  - Fulltext search - Needs to be available.
- NATS message queue server or cluster (prefered)
    - With JetStream and memory storage enabled (you probably also want to have at least `3` to `20MB` of **memory storage** available).
- Storage space: Either local filesystem directory or S3 bucket storage. - Used for avatars, faction logs and more.

## Optional

- Tracing: For OpenTelemetry based tracing support.
    - Currently only Jaeger is supported as an exporter target.
- For Development:
    - [Nuxt UI Pro license](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/pricing) - If you want to make changes to FiveNet's code and built your own images from "scratch" you need a Nuxt UI Pro license key. Recommendation is to use the official FiveNet images as your base.

## Database

::callout{icon="i-mdi-warning-circle" color="amber"}
You must ensure that the **collation** of your database, tables and columns is the same!

A difference in collation between tables can occur, e.g., when the database server has been switched. The database server defines the "default collation" used unless otherwise specified.

If the collation is not the same across at least the tables listed below, FiveNet's database migrations have a very high likely hood of **failing** due to that.

This is a list of the expected tables and the columns:

### Tables

#### `jobs` Table

- `name`
- `label`

#### `job_grades` Table

- `job_name`
- `grade`
- `name`
- `label`

#### `licenses` Table

- `type`
- `label`

#### `owned_vehicles` Table

- `owner` - `varchar(64) NOT NULL`
- `plate`
- `type`
- `model` (Optional, can be overriden via `database.custom.columns.user.visum` config option)

#### `users` Table

- `id` - `int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT`
- `identifier` - `varchar(64) NOT NULL`
- `group`
- `firstname`
- `lastname`
- `dateofbirth`
- `job`
- `job_grade`
- `sex`
- `height`
- `phone_number`
- `visum` (Optional, can be overriden via `database.custom.columns.user.visum` config option)
- `playtime` (Optional, can be overriden via `database.custom.columns.user.playtime` config option)

#### `user_licenses` Table

- `type`
- `owner` - `varchar(64) NOT NULL`

### Database/Table Collation

You must ensure that the **collation** of your database, tables and columns is the same!

A difference in collation between tables can occur, e.g., when the database server has been switched. The database server defines the "default collation" used unless otherwise specified.
If the collation is not the same across at least the tables listed below, FiveNet's database migrations have a very high likely hood of **failing** due to that.

::callout
My recommendation for database, table and column collation is `utf8mb4_general_ci` and the charset `utf8bm4`.
::

To check the collation of your database tables, you can use the following SQL queries:

```sql
USE `__YOUR_DATABASE_NAME_HERE__`;
SHOW TABLE STATUS;
```

#### Changing the database, table, column Collation

I personally have used [How to easily convert utf8 tables to utf8mb4 in MySQL 5.5 - Database Administrators Stack Exchange](https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/104866), **but**, as pointed out by the comments, with `SET foreign_key_checks = 0;` before you would run the generated queries and `SET foreign_key_checks = 1;` after you ran the generated queries.
