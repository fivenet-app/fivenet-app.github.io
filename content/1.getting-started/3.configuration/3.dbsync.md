title: DBSync
---

The DBSync is used to sync character/player, vehicles, and other data to your FiveNet instance.

Reasons why you would use the DBSync are:

- You are **not** using the FiveM ESX framework.
- To run FiveNet in "standalone" mode independent of the gameserver.
- You would not be able to make the gameserver's database server reachable by FiveNet (e.g., restricted gameserver hosting, firewalls you can't change).
- You are using the FiveNet Cloud offering.

## Configuration

The configuration file for the DBSync by default is called `dbsync.yaml`.
