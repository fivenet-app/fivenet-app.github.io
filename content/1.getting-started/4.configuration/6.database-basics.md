## Database/Table Collation

You must ensure that the **collation** of your database, tables, and columns is consistent!

A difference in collation between tables can occur, e.g., when the database server has been switched. The database server defines the "default collation" used unless otherwise specified. If the collation is not the same across at least the tables listed below, FiveNet's database migrations are very likely to **fail** due to that.

::callout
Recommended collation: `utf8mb4_general_ci`
Recommended charset: `utf8mb4`
::

To check the collation of your database tables, you can use the following SQL queries:

```sql
USE `__YOUR_DATABASE_NAME_HERE__`;
SHOW TABLE STATUS;
```

### Changing the Database, Table, or Column Collation

A useful guide for converting tables to `utf8mb4` in MySQL 5.5 can be found on the [Database Administrators Stack Exchange](https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/104866). **Important:** Before running the generated queries, disable foreign key checks with `SET foreign_key_checks = 0;`. After running the queries, re-enable them with `SET foreign_key_checks = 1;`.

::warning
Disabling foreign key checks can lead to data integrity issues if not handled carefully. Proceed with caution.

### Creating a Database User

Below are sample queries to create a database user named `fivenet` with full access to a specific database (`database_name`). Be sure to replace `password` and `database_name` with your actual values.

```sql
CREATE USER 'fivenet'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `database_name`.* TO 'fivenet'@'%';
```

## Database Management Tool Recommendation

A recommended tool for managing databases is [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), which provides a user-friendly interface for database administration.
