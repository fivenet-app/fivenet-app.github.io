title: Using Docker
---

## 1. Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose

You need Docker Engine, as the container runtime, and Docker Compose to easily run FiveNet using containers.

Please use one of the many guides available on the internet to install Docker Engine and Docker Compose on your server, e.g., <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>.

Depending on your server's operating system, make sure to start the Docker Daemon using `systemctl start docker` .

To check that Docker and Docker Compose is ready you can use the following commands:

```bash
docker version
docker-compose version
```

You can now continue to the next step of preparing the `docker-compose.yml` for your case.

## 2. Prepare `docker-compose.yml`

::callout
Container images are available from [GHCR.io fivenet-app/fivenet registry](https://github.com/fivenet-app/fivenet/pkgs/container/fivenet).
::

Checkout the [`docker-compose.yml` (click me)](https://github.com/fivenet-app/fivenet/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml) as a starting point for you.

You can remove the `mysql` container as you should use your FiveM server's database anyways.

::callout
To build the FiveNet container image yourself, you need to fulfill the [development requirements setup.](/getting-started/requirements#development)
::

If you use the NATS server from the default `docker-compose.yaml` , the `nats.url` in your FiveNet `config.yaml` should look like this: `url: "nats://fivenet:fivenet_topsecret@localhost:4222"` .

## 2.3. Prepare FiveNet Config

Checkout the [configuration page](/getting-started/configuration/config-reference) to create a `config.yaml` for FiveNet.

## 3. Run FiveNet

Run the server, worker and discord containers via the `docker-compose.yaml` :

```js
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3.1. Recommendations

If you aren't using a reverse proxy to expose FiveNet, I would recommend using, e.g., [nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy), to easily and safely expose the FiveNet server (`/`) and the Iconify API container (`/api/icons`).

## 4. Add FiveNet Plugin to your FiveM gameserver

The plugin code can be found [here](https://github.com/fivenet-app/plugins/tree/main/fivem/fivenet). Make sure to read the `README.md` and work through the instructions.

::callout
You must add event triggers to your ESX plugins accordingly, as not all events that FiveNet collects are available in the standard ESX plugin codes.
