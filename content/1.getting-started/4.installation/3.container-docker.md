## 1. Download/Build the FiveNet container images

### Docker

::callout
Container images are available from [GHCR.io fivenet-app/fivenet registry](https://github.com/fivenet-app/fivenet/pkgs/container/fivenet).
::

Checkout the [`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/fivenet-app/fivenet/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml) as an example.

- The mysql container included in it isn't needed as you must use your existing gameserver's database server.

### Building

To build the FiveNet container image you must have a [Nuxt UI Pro license key](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/pricing).

## 2. Prepare FiveNet Config

Checkout [configuration page](./configuration).

::callout
Make sure to correctly set database details, public url and session/cookie domain.
::

## 3. Run the FiveNet components

Run the server, worker and other components either via the `docker-compose.yaml` or manually via binary.

- For the server component you can add `--serve-frontend` to not have to run the frontend component as well.

## 4. Add FiveNet Plugin to your FiveM gameserver

Plugin code can be found [here](https://github.com/fivenet-app/fivenet/tree/main/plugins/fivem/fivenet).

::callout
You must add event triggers to your ESX plugins accordingly, as not all events that FiveNet collects are available in the standard ESX plugin codes.
