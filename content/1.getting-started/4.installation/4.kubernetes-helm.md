# Kubernetes

For installation to Kubernetes a Helm chart is available in our charts repository. The source code of the chart(s) is available on [GitHub fivenet-app/charts.](https://github.com/fivenet-app/charts)

## 1. Add Helm Chart Repo

```bash
helm repo add fivenet https://fivenet.app/charts
```

## 2. Get latest `values.yaml`

Use `helm show` to retrieve the latest Helm chart's `values.yaml` to get started configuring the deployment:

```js
helm show values fivenet/fivenet > values.yaml
```

## 3. Configure `values.yaml` to suit your needs

For information about the `.fivenet.config` section, please see [configuration file reference](../3.configuration/1.config-reference.md).

## 4. Install/Upgrade FiveNet to your K8S cluster

```bash
helm upgrade --install fivenet/fivenet -f values.yaml
```

Make sure to check that FiveNet is reachable externally as configured by your `values.yaml`.

## 5. Post Installation Steps

Make sure to follow the [post installation steps](6.post-install-steps.md) now.
