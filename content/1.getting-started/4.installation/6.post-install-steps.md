title: After Install Steps
---

## 1. Creating the first Account manually

Open your MySQL management tool/UI/website (e.g., `mysql` cli, [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), [PHPMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/)) and connect to the database your gameserver and FiveNet is using.

Select the `fivenet_accounts` table and create a new entry with the following values in it:

* `enabled`: `1` (= enables the account)
* `license`: Your in-game identifier/license without any prefix, such as, `char*:`, `license:`, `steam:`, `discord:` and so on.
* `reg_token`: Must be 6 numbers long. This will be your registration token which you need to register your account.

(All other fields must be left as they are)

Now open your FiveNet instance in your browser, navigate to the registration page and use your chosen registration token to create your account.

You should now be able to successfully login to FiveNet and if the `license` value of the account is correct see any characters (`users` table) that are associated with the `license`/`identifier`.

## 2. Add the FiveNet Plugin to your Gameserver

- [FiveM Plugin code - GitHub fivenet-app/plugins](https://github.com/fivenet-app/plugins/tree/main/fivem/fivenet).

::callout
Make sure to read the `README.md` of the plugin you install, and work through the instructions to get the plugin running optimally.

E.g., you must add event triggers to your ESX plugins accordingly, as not all events that FiveNet collects are available in the standard ESX plugin code.
