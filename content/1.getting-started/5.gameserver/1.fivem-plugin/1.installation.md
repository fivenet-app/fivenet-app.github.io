title: Installation
---

To integrate FiveNet with your FiveM gameserver:

1. **Download the Plugin**
    - Obtain the [FiveM Plugin code](https://github.com/fivenet-app/plugins/tree/main/fivem/fivenet) from GitHub. Ensure you download the latest version to avoid compatibility issues.

2. **Install the Plugin**
    - Place the downloaded plugin files into the appropriate directory of your FiveM server. Typically, this is the `resources` folder.

::callout
**Note:** Currently you must apply a patch to the **`yarn` builder system resource** to make it work with the FiveNet plugin. This is a temporary solution until FiveM officially switches to a newer NodeJS version.

In the `yarn/yarn_builder.js` file the list of arguments passed to the `yarn install` command must be modified to include the `--ignore-engines` flag. This allows the plugin to bypass engine checks that may not be compatible with your server's environment.

3. **Configure the Plugin**
    - Open the `config.lua` file included with the plugin and adjust the settings to match your server's requirements. This may include API keys, server identifiers, or other configuration options.

4. **Add Event Triggers**
    - Review your existing ESX plugins and add the necessary event triggers to ensure FiveNet can collect all required data. Note that not all events are included in the standard ESX plugin code, so customization may be needed.

5. **Start the Plugin**
    - Add the plugin to your server's `server.cfg` file by including the line:
      ```cfg
      ensure fivenet
      ```
    - Restart your server to load the plugin.

**Important:**

- Always read the `README.md` file provided with the plugin for detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting tips.
- Ensure your server is running a compatible version of FiveM and ESX to avoid conflicts.
