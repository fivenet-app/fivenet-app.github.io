## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve or expand our language support! If you want to contribute a language or fix translation texts, please create an issue on the FiveNet GitHub project, or directly join via [FiveNet's POEditor project link here](https://poeditor.com/join/project/hszo85uo3K).

### How to add a new language

1. Please create an issue on the FiveNet GitHub project to discuss the new language you want to add.
2. In the issue you will be asked to provide the following information:
    - Language name (e.g., `French`)
    - Language code (e.g., `fr` for French)
    - Language icon (e.g., `i-flagpack-fr` for French)
3. Once the issue is approved, you will be added the language in POEditor.
    - After that, you can create a POEditor account and join the project via [our POEditor project link here](https://poeditor.com/join/project/hszo85uo3K).
4. You can then start translating the strings in the POEditor project.
5. Developers will sync the translations from POEditor to the FiveNet project from time to time.
    - Once the translations are synced, the new language will be available in the application with the next release.
    - In case of any issues, please create an issue on the FiveNet GitHub project or ask on FiveNet Discord server.
