::callout
**TL;DR** You need an up-to-date MySQL 8.4+/MariaDB 11.4+ database server, NATS message queue server 2.11.3+ and a reverse proxy. (You roughly need a server with at least half a CPU core, 512MB of RAM and 1GB of disk space.)
::

## MySQL-based Database Server

- [MySQL 8.4+](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/) or [MariaDB 11.4+](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-114/) version or higher should be compatible (both mentioned versions are LTS releases).
    - While older versions might still work, we do not offer support or guarantee compatibility with them.
- [Fulltext search](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/fulltext-search.html) must be available (most default installations have it available/installed).

## NATS Message Queue Server

- [NATS server](https://nats.io/) must be installed and running either as a single server or cluster.
    - **At least version 2.11.3+ of NATS server is required.**
- [JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream) must be enabled.
- [JetStream memory storage](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration#jetstream-server-settings) must be enabled with at least 10-20MB of available space.

## Storage

Either **local storage (directory)** or **S3 bucket storage** is supported.

- The storage is used for avatars, faction/job logos and file uploads.
- In case you are using an S3 bucket, you must at least have read and write access to the bucket, [example AWS S3 policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_s3_rw-bucket.html).

## Domain/Subdomain

- The domain/subdomain must be publicly accessible (e.g., `https://fivenet.example.com`).
    - It must point to the server/reverse proxy that you run FiveNet on (in case of, e.g., Docker that should be your container reverse proxy, Kubernetes Helm installation the ingress controller).
- A valid HTTPS certificate for your domain/subdomain.
    - In case of Cloudflare Tunnels, you don't need a certificate as Cloudflare terminates HTTPS/SSL in front of the tunnel.
    - In case of a reverse proxy, you need to have a valid HTTPS certificate for your domain/subdomain.
    - You can use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to get a free certificate.
- The reverse proxy must be able to handle HTTP2, WebSockets and H2C.
    - For [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/), make sure to enable `http2` in the `listen` directive and use the [sophisticated websocket example from here](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/websocket.html).
- The reverse proxy must terminate HTTPS/SSL before handing the traffic to the FiveNet server.
    - The reverse proxy must be able to handle unecrypted HTTP/2 to the backend (so called H2C), and WebSockets.
    - Known reverse proxies that work are:
        - [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/): Example configuration can be found [here](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/).
        - [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/): Example configuration can be found [here](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/) and [here (GRPC + H2C)](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/user-guides/grpc/#with-http-h2c). Additionally, refer to the [Traefik HTTPS/TLS setup documentation](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/tls/) for secure connections.
        - Others might work, but have not been tested.

## Optional Requirements

- Tracing: OpenTelemetry-based tracing is available for the FiveNet server and worker components, see [Tracing](3.configuration/7.advanced.md#tracing) below. Tracing can help diagnose performance issues and monitor system behavior.
