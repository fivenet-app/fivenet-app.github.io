## Tracing

FiveNet supports OpenTelemetry based tracing for the server and worker components. This allows you to trace requests and messages through the system, which can be useful for debugging and performance analysis.
To enable tracing, you need to set the configuration options in the `config.yaml` file.
The following options are available:

```yaml
tracing:
  enabled: false
  # otlptracegrpc or otlptracehttp
  type: "otlptracegrpc"
  # OTLP Tracing endpoint URL
  url: "https://example.com:4317"
  insecure: false
  timeout: 10s
  environment: "dev"
  ratio: 0.1
  attributes:
    - service.name=fivenet-server
```
