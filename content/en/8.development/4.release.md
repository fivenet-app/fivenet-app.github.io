title: Release Process
---

FiveNet follows [Calendar Versioning aka CalVer](https://calver.org/) for simpler continuous releases.

## Creating a Release

Use the [GitHub actions `Release It!` workflow](https://github.com/fivenet-app/fivenet/actions/workflows/release-it.yml) to create a release. This workflow will:
- Create a new tag based on the current date.
- Create a new release based on the tag.
- Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with the new release information.
- Update the `version` in the `go.mod` file.
- Update the `version` in the `package.json` files.
- Update the `VERSION` file in the repository root.

### Helm Chart Versioning

Currently the Helm chart `appVersion:` is not updated automatically. You will need to do this manually.
The FiveNet Helm chart(s) `Chart.yaml` [`version:` and `appVersion:` entry](https://github.com/fivenet-app/charts/blob/main/charts/fivenet/Chart.yaml#L18-24) accordingly.
Don't forget to run `make helm-docs` to update the Helm chart `README.md` before commiting the change.

## Release Notes

The release notes are generated automatically from the commit messages. The release notes are generated using the [git-cliff CLI](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff).
