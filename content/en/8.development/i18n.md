## How to add a new Language

::callout{color="info" icon="i-mdi-information-outline"}
**Note:** This section is for developers who want to add a new language to the project. If you are not a developer, please skip this section.
::
1. Fork the FiveNet repository.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new folder and file in the `i18n/locales/` directory with the language code as the filename (e.g., `i18n/locales/fr/fr.json` for French).
4. Copy the contents of an existing language file (e.g., `en/en.json`) into the new language's folder.
5. Translate the messages/values into the new language.
6. Add the new language to the `i18n.locales` array in the `nuxt.config.ts` file.
    ```ts
    {
        name: 'French',
        code: 'fr',
        language: 'fr',
        files: ['fr/fr.json'],
        icon: 'i-flagpack-fr',
    },
    ```

    The `name` should be the name of the language in English, `code` is the language code (e.g., `de` for German), `language` is the language code used in the JSON file, and `files` is an array of files to load for that language.
7. Create a pull request with your changes.
8. Once the pull request is merged, the new language will be available in the application with the next release.
